## Inspiration

Bugs like plants, and farmers don't like that. So we made a theoretical system to automate pesticide with drones.

## What it does do?
 
Disperse dust, with drones ðŸ˜Ž

## How we built it

First, we decided on an architecture to best solve the issue of dispersing pesticide.
We ultimately decided on a set of autonomous drones which first partition a field into equal segments, scan the field for bugs using AI, and then spray affected areas with pesticide.

## What we learned

Don't try to learn math in one weekend and then implement it in an algorithm.

## What's next for us
We're looking at drone models to further implement a demo in the future.
